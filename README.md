# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
V. Isualize from PyBer,  app based ride-sharing service, has requested a summary of ride-sharing data by city type that includes a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each type of city. V. Isualize has provided rider and city data for the analysis. 
## Results

The summary table above shows that urban cities have the greater number of riders compared to suburban and rural cities. However, the avarage fare per ride and fare per driver are higher in suburban and rural cities. The average faire was $24.53, $30.97, $34.62 for urban, suburban, and rural cities, respectively. The average fare per driver was $16.57, $39.50, $55.49 for urban, suburban, and rural cities, respectively. Suburban and rural cities both had more rides than drivers whil urban cities had more drivers than rides.

While the average fare per ride was less in urban cities, the much higher number of rides resulted in urband cities generated nearly twice as much fare revenue than the next city type, suburban. Urban cities generated $39,854.38 in fares while suburban cities generated $19,356.33 in fares.

## Summary

To address the disparities among the city types I would recommend the CEO review additional ride information. Looking at the average time and/or distance of rides might provide additional insight. Urban cities tend to be more dense, riders may not need to travel as far (though traffic could result in more time to destination. Fares based on distance in ubran areas that are more populated are likely to be shorter duration but higher volume. It would also be helpful to compare demand versus supply over time. Are the drivers available when demand is high? Or, is the number of active drivers a small percentage of overall drivers? Many drivers may have signed up but don't take on riders very often. An analysis that provides a breakdown in tiers of number or riders drivers take might be helpful in further explaining the differences between city types.
